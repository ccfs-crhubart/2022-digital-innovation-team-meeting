# About Me

>Hello, I am Clint and I have worked in Information Technology since 1996 when I got my start working with a small business solutions company called Datumn Tech Industries developing GUIs for accounting applications designed in Visual Foxpro and Microsoft Access. From there relational databases, programming and then moving into networking and systems management as well as general IT management. 

>Support and client interaction has always been a integral part of what I am involved with.  

---
# What would you say you do here?
>What do I do here?  Initially I started with the NetOps team and am now working with the SysOps team, so first and foremost I go where I am needed and I learn what is needed to perform where I go. Presently Much of my time is focused on ROBLOX datacenter remote support and have also been onboarded with other clients working with virtualization and storage related things. 

---
# What drives you and why?
>I have always had a love for technology and innovations as well as helping others to feel more comfortable working with them.  The things that motivate me have always revolved closely to being part of solutions and support working with people to find the answers to problems and challenges they face.  

---
# Your thoughts on opportunities and challenges.
>It can be tough to embrace challenges and I have certainly had some less than becomming responses to new things, however as much as I like finding my groove and grinding out some results, I know that challenges are in fact oppertunities to grow, learn and overcome. Learning to gracefully embrace change is a perpetual work in progress, just like me.

# What personal investments did you make in the last 12 months, and how did they impact you and the business?
>Some of the personal investements made in the past year have included training in virtualization and storage as well as setup of a home datacenter lab (future labs probably will live in the cloud), purchase of a sit/stand desk and carving out a better office space in my attic with as many monitors as deemed neccessary.  

---
# Top professional accomplishment in the last 12 months?
>Taking on new assigments working with Virtualization and storage related things.

---
# What value did you bring to the business over the last 12 months?
>ROBLOX is probably where I have brought the most value in the last 12 months continually endevouring to take what we do to the next level.

>I like to think that I have not just onboarded with new companies and learned technical things, but actually begun to cultivate good relationships as well.  You need both in my opinion and I try to bring this attitude and perspective in everything I do.

Build Again

when building sandcastles...
it is the groundwork
  that is most essential.
to take care in the formation…
      of the footing.
 though
     one cannot at all times
         perceive imperfections
             in the sand, 
            predict strong winds
         or
            be prepared for
            rogue waves.
and yet…
all we endeavor
     seems to be
       much like sandcastles.

the key is in accepting
    when it all comes crashing down...
to properly utilize the rubble

and build again
